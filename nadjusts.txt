Note:  Estimates are adjusted for seasonal variations and holiday and trading-day differences.  Each month, new factors are developed using the latest estimates and applied to the not adjusted advance,
preliminary, and final estimates and to the estimates of the previous year that correspond to the advance and preliminary months.  The sales adjustment factors are not included in this table for
those kinds of business for which adjusted estimates are not shown separately.  Adjusted sales estimates are obtained by dividing the not adjusted estimates by the adjustment factors shown above for
corresponding kinds of business.  Adjusted estimates for the summary trade totals are obtained by summarizing the adjusted estimates for the individual kind of business.  The options used to derive factors
for each kind of business were selected during the last benchmarking operation and will not be subject to modification until the next benchmarking operation.  These options are available upon request.
